# Call Sound Assets

This folder should contain the following sound files for video calling:

- `ringtone.mp3` - Played on loop when receiving an incoming call
- `dialtone.mp3` - Played on loop when making an outgoing call (waiting for answer)
- `hangup.mp3` - Played once when a call ends

## Where to get sounds

You can use royalty-free sounds from:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/

## Recommended specifications

- Format: MP3
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz
- Bitrate: 128-192 kbps
- Duration:
  - ringtone.mp3: 3-5 seconds (will loop)
  - dialtone.mp3: 3-5 seconds (will loop)

If sounds are missing, the app will work normally but without audio feedback.
